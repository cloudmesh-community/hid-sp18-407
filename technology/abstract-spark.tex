Apache Spark is an open-source platform for large-scale, fault-tolerant, 
distributed data processing at speeds up to 100x faster than MapReduce. \cite{hid-sp18-407-spark-Aven}
Spark has several high-level APIs including those for 
Java, Scala, SQL, R, and Python, allowing development and deployment of 
complex applications at scale, while offering a low-latency, fault-tolerant 
application framework. \cite{hid-sp18-407-spark-Aven}
Spark was developed to replace MapReduce on Hadoop, and 
supports a wide range of applications, including real-time event processing, 
complex data analytics, and recommendation engines.  \cite{hid-sp18-407-sparkhadoop}

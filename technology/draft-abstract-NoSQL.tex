NoSQL, or \textit{Not only SQL} represents a class of several
technologies that function as distributed database storage and
operation, including Cassandra and HBase.  Characteristics include
databases that are ``schema-less at design-time and
\textit{schema-on-read} at run time''
\cite{hid-sp18-407-nosql}. Unlike relational database management
systems, NoSQL databases have no pre-defined relation with any other
object. Finally, NoSQL structure and query typically avoids joins at
all costs. \cite{hid-sp18-407-nosql} NoSQL databases are built on
distributed networks and are favorable due to superior speed and
performance over traditional RDBMS.

# Meetings in the Week of Jan 28th

# Past Meetings

## github.com

* yes, we want github.com and not the iu github. E.g. iu github is not a true open 
  source platform. As we do open source, iu github is not meeting our goals.
* when applying for an account, make sure that you use the correct e-mail, and 
  check the e-mail as you will get invitations from github that you need to accept.
* you can set upi github so you recieve e-mails when a TA or instructir changes things.
* Before starting anything you should do always a git pull
* Leanr about github

## github issues

* a very nice feature is github issues that we want you to learn. It allows you to organize 
  your tasks and even create weekly milestones that you can use.
* in addition if you use bulleted liste with a [ ] in it it creates cliackble bullet lists. 
  A super cool feature.

  
## Filling out forms

* it is important that you fill out forms correctly
* when we ask you for a github account, we ask you for the github account.
  Please research the differene between an e-mail and an accountname on
  github
* make sure you use the same capitalization

## notebook.md

* When using bullet points do not copy strange characters from words itemized list, 
  but use the "star" above the eight on the keyboard.
  
## 80 characters

* You will have noticed that github has a maximum length of characters for text.
  It is best to use at most 80 characters
* Emacs suppports this super simple in its auto-fill-mode with ESC-q it even formats 
  bulleted lists
* pyCharm supports this through configurations
* we do not recommend to use editors that do not support this feature. Look up your editors 
  documentation

Apache Mesos is an open-source framework that aims to provide efficient
resource management and shared access in large cluster computing frameworks. 
``Apache Mesos provides efficient resource isolation and 
sharing across distributed applications in Cloud environments
as well as private datacenters'' \cite{hid-sp18-407-mesos-1}.
Mesos is a resource management and allocation platform used for 
distributed computing managementAirbnb, eBay, and Microsoft Azure. 
``Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing 
frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data 
stored on each machine'' \cite{hid-sp18-407-mesos-2}.
Apache Mesos can provide an efficient way for users to access 
data on multiple cluster computing frameworks. \cite{hid-sp18-407-mesos-2}

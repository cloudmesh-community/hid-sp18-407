Notes: 
- Page limit 8 pages. Should be about why this tech is important, why it's exciting, what does it do? 
- Spark is ok.  516 is Hadoop related. 
- Tutorial - tell about technology and build tutorial.  Precursor to project. 
- Project = how do you actually run project so a TA can actually replicate. Shouldn't have 50 steps - how does a makefile work? 
- Makefile is super important. Learn how to create/run a makefile! 
  - don't check in any code that we haven't developed.  e.g. swagger codegen.  
  - we can ship code that doesn't require all the code.  
- Hadoop...look at chameleon cloud's hadoop deployment.  
- Containers. 
- 516 class is a little less stressful - intro course! Teaching python, how to write a paper. 
- Swagger service - we will use the swagger service in the project.  
- Can you recommend ways to get exposure to distributed computing practice?  


RDD - what is an RDD?  RDD stands for resilient distributed database, which is the Spark abstraction for data storage.  


Spark Session
As compared to Spark SQL

Spark SQL
Spark SQL is the entry point for working with structured data in dataframes:  
- http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext
- Spark SQL has a nice JDBC interface for reading JSON and Hive files. 

Spark Streaming
This is Spark's module for big data functionality.  It interacts with other Spark modules such as MLib. 

MLib
Spark's machine learning library. 

Interactivity. 
Spark runs on the JVM and interacts with Python, Java, Scala and other high-level languages.

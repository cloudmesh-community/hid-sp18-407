\section{MLib}

MLib is Apache Spark's machine learning library providing 
access to several algorithms within the Spark framework
utilizing the Spark shell. Some of the algorithms include 
linear and logistic regression, collaborative filtering, 
clustering (k-means) and decomposition (PCA)~\cite{hid-sp18-407-mlib-1}.
MLib provides better scalability, and because it's used within Spark, 
there is no need for context-switching. This allows users to develop
models in a distributed environment with the performance of in-memory 
models, with the added benefit of access to large amounts of data
~\cite{hid-sp18-407-mlib-1}.

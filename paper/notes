Spark SQL
Spark SQL is the entry point for working with structured data in dataframes:  
- http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext
- Spark SQL has a nice JDBC interface for reading JSON and Hive files. 

Spark Streaming
This is Spark's module for big data functionality.  It interacts with other Spark modules such as MLib. 

MLib
Spark's machine learning library. 

Interactivity. 
Spark runs on the JVM and interacts with Python, Java, Scala and other high-level languages.
